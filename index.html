            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Bauhaus is the first college in the world to be founded entirely for the development of
              modern design education. It was founded in 1919 by German architect Walter Groups. The
              establishment of Bauhaus marks the birth of modern design education.  </p>
              <p>The school combines
              art and technology to cultivate a large number of designers with international influence. But after
              only 14 years the school was closed from the Nazis. The Bauhaus movement championed a geometric,
              abstract style featuring little sentiment or emotion and no historical nods, and its aesthetic
              continues to influence architects, designers and artists.</p>

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>Understated, simple, minimalist – these are all words that people often associate with Bauhaus style.
              But there is no single, one-size-fits-all definition for this ground-breaking design style. </p>
              <p>In fact, the
              movement is more about a series of styles directions that sprung from the original Bauhaus concept.
              Walter Gropius, architect and founder of the Bauhaus school in Weimar, believed that all objects should be simple,
              beautiful, functional and accessible to all – and this definition of design is what continues to influence designers
              right up to the present day.</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p> The Bauhaus School taught typography, and they were strong advocates of sans-serif type, as they believed that its
              simplified geometric form was more appealing and useful than the ornate German standard of blackletter typography.</p>
              <p>Bauhaus style of typography is effective in conveying the message of the design. Balanced layout, harmonious geometric
              shapes, vibrant colors, and sans-serif letters in upper case or lower case fonts are simple but strong.
              Bauhaus layout was not only horizontal and vertical, but angled as well, or wrapped around objects. </p>
            <p>The influence
              on the modern day posters and designs is evident, as you can see the legacy of the German school on various book
              and album covers, as well as political posters and signs. One of the most notable examples is the poster for
              Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, heavily influenced by its German predecessor.
              So, if you want to see some of the fine examples of Bauhaus typography, scroll down and enjoy
              the simplicity and power of these works.</p>
